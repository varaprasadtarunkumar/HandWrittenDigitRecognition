    git clone https://github.com/varaprasadtarunkumar/HandWrittenDigitRecognition.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the UI by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Browse" button to upload a handwritten digit image.
3. Once uploaded, view the predicted results displayed on the UI.

## Conclusion
