#Enhancing Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning Algorithms

##Overview

This project aims to enhance handwritten digit recognition using deep learning algorithms, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The primary objective is to determine the best algorithm among the three for image classification tasks.

##Features
User-friendly UI for inputting handwritten digit images.
Backend processing for prediction using ANN, CNN, and RNN.
Display of predicted classes and their accuracies in a grid format.
Identification of the best-performing model.
